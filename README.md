# SMS-SPAM-DETECTOR
IN THIS REPO I HAVE CREATED A WEBAPP TO PREDICT WHETHER  A SMS IS SPAM OR NOT.
steps DONE IN THIS PROJECT 
1ST ATKEN A DATSET FROM KAGGLE THEN DID UNI & MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS ON THE THE TEXT DATA WITH TARGET COL.
2ND COUNTED NO OF WORDS ,SENTENCE,CHARACTERS  TO LINK A RELATION WITH SPAM SMS & THEN USING NLTKCONVERTED TEXT DATA TO NUMERIC DATA
3RD USED MULTINOMAIL NAIVE BAYES AS ITS PRECISION & ACCURACY WAS BEST AMONG ALL TEH MODELS CHECKED.
THEN IMPORTED NECESSARY PKL FILE USING PCKLE SUCH AS VECTORIZER TO CONVERT INPUT TEXT TO NUMERIC & MODEL OBJ TO TARIN & PREDICT AND DEPLOYED THE MODEL ON STEAMLIT.
